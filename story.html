  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p class="highlight">not just coffee. it’s a feeling.</p>

  <p>
    It started with a simple thought:<br>
    why does coffee always taste better when you’re not in a rush?
  </p>

  <p>
    We wanted to create a space where time slows down a little.
    Where mornings feel gentler.
    Where evenings don’t ask questions.
    Where coffee isn’t just a drink-it’s comfort.
  </p>

  <h3>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</h3>

  <p>
    This café began as a quiet dream and a loud love for coffee.
    One person, countless cups, and a belief that the best conversations
    happen over something warm.
  </p>

  <p>
    No big plan.<br>
    No perfect start.<br>
    Just a small idea that grew — one brew at a time.
  </p>

  <p>
    What began as a tiny corner soon became a place people returned to.
    Not because they had to.
    But because they wanted to.
  </p>

  <h3>OUR COFFEE,OUR WAY</h3>

  <p>
    We take our coffee seriously-but never ourselves.
  </p>

  <ul class="story-list">
    <li>thoughtfully sourced</li>
    <li>carefully brewed</li>
    <li>made with patience, not shortcuts</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We believe good coffee takes time.
    And great coffee takes heart.
  </p>

  <p>
    From classic comfort brews to drinks you’ll screenshot before sipping-
    everything here is made to feel familiar and exciting.
  </p>

  <h3>THE SPACE !</h3>

  <p>This is your place.</p>

  <ul class="story-list">
    <li>solo dates with your thoughts</li>
    <li>study sessions that turn into playlists</li>
    <li>first conversations and last laughs</li>
    <li>quiet corners and window seats</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The music is soft.<br>
    The lights are warm.<br>
    The vibe is calm.
  </p>

  <p>
    You don’t have to dress up.<br>
    You don’t have to rush.<br>
    You can just… exist.
  </p>

  <h3>THE PEOPLE</h3>

  <p>
    Behind the counter are humans who care.
    Who remember your order.
    Who smile when you walk in.
  </p>

  <p>
    And in front of it?<br>
    People like you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Regulars. Dreamers. Students. Creatives.<br>
    Strangers who slowly become familiar faces.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s the magic.
  </p>

  <h3>WHAT WE BELIEVE IN</h3>

  <ul class="story-list">
    <li>coffee made with intention</li>
    <li> kindness, always</li>
    <li>good playlists</li>
    <li> small joys</li>
    <li>community over everything</li>
  </ul>

  <p>

    Still growing.<br>
    Still learning.
